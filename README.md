**Termigo** is a lightweight open-source, terminal-first AI-native development
environment (ADE) built on **Tauri 2 + Rust** with a **React 19** frontend. A
native PTY backend, an agentic AI side-panel that runs against your own keys or
fully local models, a code editor, file explorer, source control with a git
graph, and a web preview pane, all in one window. **No telemetry. No account.**
Your API keys stay in the OS keychain or with the provider's own CLI.

This project is a **fork of [Terax](https://github.com/crynta/terax-ai)**
(by Crynta, Apache-2.0), extended with a **Go command-line companion**
(`termi-go`) for automation: agent runs, MCP, skills, and project scaffolding.

## Features

### Terminal

- Native PTY backend via `portable-pty` (pwsh, powershell, cmd, zsh, bash, fish)
- xterm.js with WebGL renderer, multi-tab with background streaming
- Split panels (horizontal and vertical)
- Inline search, link detection, true-color
- Drag files from the explorer into a terminal as shell-safe quoted paths
- Per-tab workspace environments on Windows (Local or WSL distro)
- Spaces restore tabs, working directories, and split layouts across launches

### SSH & remote files

- Connect to remote hosts with **ssh-agent**, private key, or password auth,
  directly as a terminal tab (ProxyJump chains supported)
- First-connect **host-key verification** (trust-on-first-use with fingerprint
  pinning): the handshake pauses until you confirm
- **SFTP file explorer**: browse, create, rename, delete, upload (drag & drop)
  and download over the active SSH session
- Port forwarding (`-L`) through the session

### AI agent

- **BYOK providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Groq,
  xAI (Grok), Cerebras, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, plus any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Local / offline:** LM Studio, MLX, Ollama
- **Skills.** The agent writes reusable procedures for itself in
  `.termigo/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — a deploy sequence, a debugging route that
  worked, a release checklist — and reads them back in later sessions. This is
  what makes it better over time rather than merely better informed: memory
  stops a session starting from zero, a skill means a procedure worked out once
  never has to be worked out again. Re-saving a name replaces it, so a skill
  improves with use. Only names and descriptions reach the system prompt;
  bodies load on demand through `use_skill`, so a shelf of skills costs almost
  nothing until one is needed. Plain Markdown with frontmatter, so you can read,
  edit or delete any of them by hand. `find_skill` searches every skill library
  on the machine on demand — your own, and those installed by other agent tools
  — so a large collection stays reachable without any of it sitting in the
  prompt. Skills written for another agent still parse, and `use_skill` says so
  when one calls tools Termigo does not have.
- **Self-maintaining memory.** The agent records durable project facts in
  `.termigo/memory.md` and reads them back in every later session, so build
  commands, conventions and decisions do not have to be re-explained. Facts are
  captured two ways: a `remember` tool the model calls deliberately (visible in
  the transcript, approval-gated like any workspace write), and a summary sweep
  when a session is left behind. Your hand-written `TERMIGO.md` is never
  rewritten, so you can always tell what you wrote from what the agent
  inferred, and deleting a line makes it forget. The file is bounded in entry
  length, entry count and total size, because everything in it costs context on
  every request. The sweep only runs in the auto-approve modes: in
  `Ask every time`, nothing is written without a click.
- **Sub-agents read in parallel.** Work that means covering a lot of ground —
  auditing a project, exploring an unfamiliar codebase, reviewing four modules —
  is split into tasks that run at the same time, each with its own fresh
  context, and their findings come back together. Tasks can be chained: one
  that declares `depends_on` waits for the others and receives what they found,
  so a task that synthesises can be handed everything the others gathered.
  A request to study something broad is pinned to this fan-out, because a model
  asked politely in a prompt to parallelise will ignore it; a narrow request is
  left alone, and telling it not to use sub-agents is respected.

  **They read; they do not write.** A sub-agent's tools are `read_file`,
  `list_directory`, `grep` and `glob`, and what it returns is a written summary,
  not code. So a batch can explore widely with nothing changed behind you — but
  asking for a site to be built does not become four builders working at once.
  The main agent still makes every edit, in order. Concurrent writing needs an
  approval flow that a headless run does not have yet.
- **One reasoning block per run, not one per step.** The agent's thinking is
  collected into a single block that scrolls, instead of a new "Reasoned" label
  stacking up on every step and pushing the answer off screen. The tool calls it
  produced stay visible around it, so you can still see what it actually did.
- **Every run writes one line you can read.** The app log records, per request:
  how long context assembly took, the prompt size broken down by what
  contributed it, the cache hit rate, how many steps were used against the
  budget, why the run stopped, and the model. When the agent feels slow, that
  line says which part was slow — an MCP server starting, a large project
  memory, a cold cache — instead of leaving you to guess. Most of the fixes in
  recent releases were found by reading it.
- **Steer, stop and resume a run.** Typing while the agent works queues the
  message and delivers it when the current run settles, so a correction reaches
  it instead of being dropped — attachments included. Queued messages are shown
  with a way to take them back. Stop reaches the work, not just the reply: it
  kills the command the agent is running rather than leaving a shell going
  behind a stopped agent, and the transcript then offers to continue. An
  interrupted tool call is closed out as interrupted rather than erased, so the
  model can see its work was cut short instead of being shown a past in which it
  never made the call — and repeating it.
- **The run says why it stopped, and goes deeper when you ask.** One request
  gets 25 steps, the same default as VS Code's agent mode, and each Continue
  moves up a ladder to 50 then 100. A light task never pays for a heavy one,
  and a refactor is not capped by a number picked before anyone knew what the
  task was. Two guards sit alongside the budget: the same tool called three
  times with identical input, and two turns in a row that call no tool at all.
  The transcript names which one fired, because "it repeated itself" and "it ran
  out of budget" call for different responses — one is worth a click, the other
  is worth a sentence of extra detail.
- **You can read the request, not infer it.** Turn on `Capture requests`
  (Settings → Agents → Diagnostics) and an inspector appears in the AI bar
  holding each request as assembled: the system prompt, the message history
  after pruning and compaction, and **the exact tool set attached on that
  step** — which is usually the answer when the agent ignores a tool you
  expected it to use, or reaches for one you did not. A rejection names a
  symptom and the transcript shows the reply; neither shows the three things
  that decide what actually happens. Captures are kept in memory only, never
  written to disk, capped at 30, and hold no API keys: the snapshot is taken
  before the provider SDK attaches credentials.
- **The agent can define its own tools.** A command worth repeating is saved as
  a named tool with `{{placeholders}}` in `.termigo/tools.json` and called by
  name afterwards. It is a command template, not code — running one goes
  through the same shell safety check, approval tier and remote routing as
  `bash_run`, so a custom tool can do nothing the agent could not already do.
  Arguments are shell-quoted with no raw mode.
- Agentic workflow: plans, sub-agents, project memory via `TERMIGO.md`,
  read, write, edit, multi-edit, grep, glob, move, copy, delete,
  cross-file literal replace, HTTP fetch, bash with approval gating,
  background processes, and SSH port forwarding so a service on a remote host
  becomes reachable locally
- Tool calls are **approval-gated**; approvals resume the run (including
  OpenAI-compatible providers such as DeepSeek)
- **Graduated auto-approval.** Choose how much the agent may do without
  stopping: `Ask every time` (default), `Auto-approve edits` (file changes in
  the workspace run, commands and agent hand-offs still ask), or
  `Auto-approve all`. The mode is always visible in the AI status bar, never
  buried in settings. Crucially it changes only *what stops for a click*: the
  path and shell-command safety checks run inside every tool regardless, so no
  mode can authorise something the safety layer refuses. Read-only tools never
  asked in the first place.
- **Deleting is never delegated.** No mode speaks for you here, including
  `Auto-approve all`: `delete_file` always asks, and so does any command that
  removes files — `rm`, `rmdir`, `git clean`, `find -delete`, PowerShell's
  `Remove-Item` and its aliases — wherever it sits in the line, so
  `pnpm build && rm -rf dist` is not read as a build. The gate follows the
  command rather than the tool name, so a custom tool cannot route around it.
  Every other change an agent makes can be recovered by reading the file again
  or from git; a delete of something untracked leaves nothing to read at all,
  and that asymmetry is worth one click even from someone who has delegated
  everything else.
- **Agent works on the remote host.** When the active terminal is an SSH
  session, the agent's file tools act on the server: `read_file`,
  `list_directory`, `write_file`, `create_directory`, `edit`, `multi_edit`,
  `move_file` and `delete_file` all go over SFTP. Windows drive paths (`C:\...`)
  still mean this machine, since they cannot mean anything on a POSIX host.
  `grep` and `glob` search the server too, using its own `grep` and `find` over
  a dedicated exec channel rather than walking the tree over SFTP — one command
  instead of thousands of round trips. Every value interpolated into those
  commands is single-quoted, so a pattern cannot become a second command.
  `bash_run` runs on the server too, from the remote shell's working directory,
  so the agent can install packages, reload Caddy or bring a compose stack up
  without you relaying commands. Remote commands are gated by what they do rather than by
  being remote: under `Auto-approve edits`, one that only inspects (`ls`,
  `docker ps`, `git status`) runs, and anything that could change the server
  stops for a click — as does anything the classifier does not recognise. Under
  `Ask every time` all of them ask; under `Auto-approve all` none do, except one
  that deletes — that asks on any host, in any mode. `replace_in_files`, `copy_file` and `bash_background` still
  have no remote form and refuse while a session is open, saying what to use
  instead rather than quietly acting on your own disk.
- **Tools the agent defines for itself.** After running something worth
  repeating, the agent can save it as a named tool with `create_tool`, and call
  it by name from then on. A tool is a shell command template with
  `{{placeholders}}`, stored in `.termigo/tools.json` — not code. Running one
  goes through the same path `bash_run` takes, so the shell safety check, the
  approval tiers and the remote/local routing all apply unchanged: a custom
  tool can do nothing the agent could not already do. Every argument is
  shell-quoted on substitution, with no raw mode, so a value can never become a
  second command.
- **Extension tools.** An extension that declares `contributes.aiTools` in its
  manifest has those tools offered to the agent as `ext__<extension>__<tool>`,
  with the JSON Schema and approval preference it declared. Like MCP tools they
  never ride along with `Auto-approve edits`, since that mode is a statement
  about files in your workspace, not about third-party code.
- **MCP servers.** Tools from any configured Model Context Protocol server are
  offered to the agent alongside the built-in ones, named `mcp__<server>__<tool>`
  so their origin stays visible in the transcript. Configure them in
  `.termigo/mcp.json` in the workspace, or `~/.termigo/mcp.json` for every
  project, using the standard `mcpServers` shape:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        "env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "..." }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  A project entry overrides a user entry of the same name, and the same file is
  read by the Go companion CLI, so a server configured once works in both. MCP
  tools always ask for approval, including under `Auto-approve edits`: that mode
  is a statement about files in this workspace, not about arbitrary third-party
  actions. A server that fails to start costs only its own tools, not everyone
  else's.
- Coding-agent orchestration: spawn Claude Code in a terminal, inspect output,
  send follow-up work through approval-gated tools
- Composer: prompt snippets via `#handle`, files via `@path`, voice input
- Custom agents with their own system prompt and tool subset
- Plan mode for multi-step work, generates and confirms before doing

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [Tauri platform prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
  (Windows: MSVC Build Tools; Linux: webkit2gtk; macOS: Xcode CLT)

### Run from source

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev       # development
pnpm tauri build     # production bundle
```

Checks:

```bash
pnpm check-types     # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test            # vitest
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

### Windows notes

- Default shell detection: `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+) → `powershell.exe` →
  `cmd.exe`
- WSL is a first-class workspace environment, not a wrapped subprocess

## CLI

Termigo ships **two** separate command-line programs. They do different jobs,
and only the first one is installed with the app.

### 1. Control CLI (Rust, bundled with the app)

Installed alongside the desktop app as `termigo`. It talks to a **running**
Termigo window over the local control socket:

```bash
termigo README.md              # open a file in the running app
termigo README.md --line 42    # open at a line
termigo open README.md         # explicit form of the same thing
termigo ping                   # is the app reachable?
termigo capabilities           # what this build supports
termigo identify               # which window/pane answered
termigo help
```

It does **not** know `agent`, `mcp`, `skill`, `doctor` or `init`. Those belong
to the Go companion below, and asking this binary for them now says so.

### 2. Go companion (automation)

Lives in [`cli/`](cli/) and is **not** installed by the app. It automates what
the desktop surfaces interactively and runs without the app open.

```bash
cd cli
go build -o termi-go ./cmd/termigo   # or: go run ./cmd/termigo <args>
```

Name the binary something other than `termigo` (for example `termi-go`), or
put it on `PATH` ahead of the control CLI. Two binaries with the same name is
exactly what makes `termigo agent list` fail confusingly.

```bash
./termi-go help
./termi-go doctor --json                # inspect local tools
./termi-go init <dir>                   # scaffold .termigo/ + TERMIGO.md
./termi-go agent list                   # installed agent providers
./termi-go agent run codex "explain this repo" --access read-only
./termi-go skill create review "Review diffs before commit"
./termi-go mcp list                     # configured MCP servers
./termi-go mcp tools fs                 # list tools of an MCP server
./termi-go config                       # show user configuration
```

- **Providers:** Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Antigravity, Ollama (local).
  `agent run` drives Codex, Claude and Gemini in print mode and Ollama over its
  local HTTP API; a provider with no headless mode is reported rather than
  launched blind.
- **Provider overrides:** `providers.<id>.command` in `~/.termigo/config.json`
  points at a CLI installed outside `PATH`; `model` and `endpoint` are honoured
  the same way.
- **Skills:** project- and user-scoped `SKILL.md` folders under
  `.termigo/skills/` and `~/.termigo/skills/`
- **MCP:** standard `mcpServers` registry in `.termigo/mcp.json`, JSON-RPC 2.0
  over stdio (initialize, tools/list, tools/call, ping)
- **Never stores API keys**: credentials stay with each provider's own CLI

See [`docs/`](docs/) for the MCP, skills, agents, and architecture guides.

## Architecture

```text
Termigo
|-- Desktop application        Rust + Tauri 2 + React 19 + TypeScript
|   |-- src-tauri/             PTY, shell, git, agents, workspace, control
|   `-- src/                   React UI (terminal, editor, AI, git, explorer)
`-- termigo CLI                Go
    `-- cli/                   agent, mcp, skill, config, doctor, init
```

A Tauri 2 app: a React 19 webview talks to a Rust backend via `invoke()` and
streaming `Channel`s. The Go CLI is the automation layer: anything useful
headlessly lives in `cli/internal/` first.

## Privacy and safety

- **Local first.** Folders, commands, keys, and project context stay on the
  machine. No telemetry, no account.
- **Keys stay with their owners.** Provider credentials live in the provider's
  own CLI config or the OS keychain.
- **Approval gates.** Agent file changes and commands require review/approval;
  the workspace is the boundary for file operations.
- **MCP is explicit.** Servers only run when you configure and connect to them.
