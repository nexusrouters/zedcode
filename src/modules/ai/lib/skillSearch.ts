// Finding a skill anywhere on the machine, without paying for it up front.
//
// This machine has 622 SKILL.md files: 620 in Codex's plugin cache, two in
// OpenClaw's. Putting even their names and descriptions in the system prompt
// would cost tens of kilobytes on every request - several times the entire
// memory budget - for a shelf the current task almost never needs.
//
// So the library is searched on demand instead. The agent asks for what it
// wants, gets a handful of candidates back, and reads one. Same shape as the
// workspace's own skills, one level further out: index nothing, fetch on
// request.
//
// Matching runs on directory names before any file is opened. Skill
// directories are named descriptively by convention - `airtable-cli`,
// `browser-automation`, `plugin-creator` - so a name filter answers most
// queries, and only the survivors are read to get their descriptions. Reading
// 620 files to answer one question would take seconds and most of them would
// score zero.
