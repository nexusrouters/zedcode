// Checking whether a skill can actually be followed here.
//
// Skills travel between agent tools because the file format is shared, but the
// format is the easy half. A skill is instructions referring to capabilities,
// and it is only portable if those capabilities exist. OpenClaw's
// browser-automation skill parses perfectly in ZedCode and is useless in it:
// every step calls a `browser` tool that does not exist, so the agent would
// follow a procedure into a wall.
//
// Two signals, in order of trust:
//
//   declared  - a `tools:` line in the frontmatter. Exact, when present.
//   referenced - snake_case identifiers in backticks. A guess, but a good one.
//
// The heuristic deliberately ignores single words. `browser`, `npm` and
// `docker` in backticks are as likely to be a program as a tool, and a checker
// that cries wolf gets ignored - which costs more than the misses. Multi-word
// snake_case (`browser_click`, `run_in_terminal`) is almost always a tool name.
