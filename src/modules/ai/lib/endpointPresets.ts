// These are presets, not providers. ZedCode already talks to any
// OpenAI-compatible service through a custom endpoint; what was missing was
// knowing the base URL, which is the one field a user cannot guess and the one
// most likely to be mistyped.
//
// Deliberately not first-class providers with pinned model lists. A hardcoded
// model id is wrong the week the service renames it, and then it is wrong in a
// shipped binary. A preset fills the URL and suggests a model, and every field
// stays editable - so a stale suggestion costs one correction rather than a
// release.
