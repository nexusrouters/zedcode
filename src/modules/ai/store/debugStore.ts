/**
 * In-memory capture of the requests ZedCode assembles for the provider.
 *
 * Diagnosing an agent problem meant guessing at what had actually been sent:
 * a provider rejection names a symptom, and the transcript shows what came
 * back, but neither shows the system prompt, the compacted history, or which
 * tools were attached on that particular step. This holds exactly that.
 *
 * Filled only while `debugCaptureEnabled` is on. Never persisted - a capture
 * is the conversation in full, and that belongs in memory for as long as the
 * window is open and nowhere else. It imports nothing from `../lib` or
 * `../tools`, so the agent loop can record into it without a cycle.
 *
 * Keys and auth headers are not part of a snapshot: what is recorded is the
 * request as assembled, before the provider SDK attaches credentials.
