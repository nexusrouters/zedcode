# Roadmap

ZedCode direction, what's shipped, what's coming, and what's deliberately out of scope.

This file is updated as direction evolves. For day-to-day work, see [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nexusrouters/zedcode/issues) and the Projects board.

## What ZedCode is

ZedCode is a fast, lightweight, terminal-first AI-native development environment (ADE). It pairs a native PTY backend with a modern UI: multi-tab terminals, an integrated code editor, a file explorer, source control, and a first-class AI agent system that works with your own API keys or fully local models. About 7-8 MB on disk. No telemetry. Keys stored in the OS keychain.

The product is opinionated: terminal-first, AI as a primitive (not a sidebar), lightweight always, cross-platform without compromise.

## What ZedCode is not

- Not an IDE clone. ZedCode selectively integrates high-value editor capabilities such as LSP, AI autocomplete, formatting, source control, and previews without adopting the heavyweight runtime and always-on background services of a traditional IDE.
- Not a browser. Web preview exists for local dev servers and lightweight doc viewing only.
- Not a general workspace. Tools and formats that pull the product away from the terminal-first surface are out of scope.
- Not a one-size-fits-all CLI replacement. The goal is the best terminal-first AI-native development environment, not a shell with extras.

## Themes

The themes below frame every scope decision.

1. **AI as a native primitive.** Agents, tools, autocomplete, voice - first-class, not a panel bolted onto a regular terminal.
2. **Lightweight always.** 7-8 MB binary. Every dependency justified. Per-tab memory budget enforced.
3. **Terminal-first.** xterm.js correctness, PTY fidelity, TUI app compatibility are non-negotiable.
4. **Cross-platform parity.** macOS, Linux, Windows, WSL. No platform-specific exclusives.
5. **Security by default.** Path guards, SSRF protection, OSC trust, IPC sandboxing. Defaults safe out of the box.

### AI

- [x] Multiple cloud and local providers (BYOK)

- [x] Voice input
- [x] Reusable prompt snippets via `#handle`
- [x] Project memory and per-project configuration

- [x] Extension-contributed AI tools
- [x] Agent-defined tools as shell templates in `.zedcode/tools.json`
- [x] Tools with per-action approval gating (file write / edit, bash, and filesystem mutations)
- [x] Graduated auto-approval modes, with deletion never delegated in any mode
- [x] Step budgets that escalate per Continue, with named stop reasons
- [x] Per-run diagnostics line and an opt-in request inspector
- [x] Workspace file picker
- [x] Auto-compact for long context

### SSH and remote

- [x] SSH sessions with key and password auth, and `known_hosts` verification
- [x] SFTP-backed remote file browsing and editing
- [x] Port forwarding, so a service on the remote host is reachable locally
- [x] Agent file tools follow the session onto the remote host, with `grep` and `glob` running server-side
- [x] Remote commands gated by what they do rather than by being remote

### Previews

- [x] Auto-detected local dev server preview
- [x] Image, video, audio, and PDF viewers
- [x] Rendered Markdown preview with raw and rendered views
- [x] Sandboxed iframe

- [x] No telemetry

### Security

- [x] Hardened AI tool surface (file system, network, IPC)
- [x] SSRF and DNS rebinding defenses on outbound HTTP
- [x] Trust gating in terminal escape-sequence handling
- [x] Sandboxed preview surface

### Engineering

- [x] Regression coverage across critical PTY, security, AI tool, editor, explorer, theme, and native-boundary behavior
- [x] Enforced startup and total client bundle budgets with heavy editor, AI, Markdown, and source-control surfaces loaded on demand

## Planned

### Coming next

- [ ] AI-powered inline terminal suggestions, opt-in (history-based suggestions have shipped)
- [ ] AI agent reliability and workflow improvements (tool execution, context management, recovery, and long-running tasks)
- [ ] Sub-agents that write, not only read - the concurrent-approval flow needs designing first
- [ ] Expand external coding-agent orchestration beyond Claude Code
- [ ] Extensible slash commands (a fixed set has shipped; skills are done)
- [ ] Project-scoped approval policies and per-tool trust (the auto-approve modes have shipped)
- [ ] Persistent terminal processes across app restarts

### Longer horizon

- [ ] Selective TS → Rust migration where the profiler shows measurable wins
- [ ] AI tools / skills as installable bundles

## Wanted contributions

Strategic areas where help is welcome. Pick something and propose an approach in Discord or via an issue first.

- **Regression tests.** Add focused coverage for bug fixes and critical PTY, security, AI tool, and native-boundary invariants.
- **Measured performance work.** Profile first and propose focused changes that preserve startup time, bundle size, memory use, and hot-path latency.
- **Platform-specific bugs.** Rendering issues on niche distros, shell quirks, WSL edge cases.
- **Documentation and translations.** Improvements, screenshots, examples, non-English README sections.
- **Themes.** Terminal and editor themes, UI accent palettes that fit the lightweight aesthetic.
- **Provider integrations.** Only providers that add unique value beyond existing coverage. Justify the case before implementing.

See `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` labels on GitHub Issues for concrete tasks.

## Out of scope

Categories that will not be built into ZedCode. Individual feature requests in these categories will be closed.

- **Heavyweight IDE infrastructure.** Integrated debugger and profiler suites, unbounded background indexing, and always-resident extension hosts are out of scope. Focused LSP, autocomplete, formatting, and editor workflows remain in scope when they are opt-in, lazy, and resource-bounded.
- **Notebook and document workspaces.** Anything that turns ZedCode into a document host rather than a terminal.
- **Package manager and toolchain UIs.** Use `npm`, `pip`, `cargo` and friends in the terminal directly.
- **Full web browser features.** Preview pane stays scoped to local dev servers and lightweight doc viewing. No navigation history, no bookmarks, no dev tools.
- **Telemetry, analytics, accounts.** ZedCode stays BYOK and offline-respectful.
- **Extension marketplaces at IDE scale.** Narrowly-scoped AI tool / skill bundles may happen eventually. Arbitrary UI or behavior extensions will not.
- **Third-party subscription session bridges.** Forwarding cloud subscription auth (provider-managed login sessions) through ZedCode is not technically feasible for third-party clients.

## Decision authority

Direction and scope decisions are made by [@nexusrouters](https://github.com/nexusrouters). Trusted reviewers (informal, no fixed roles yet) provide input on security, performance, and platform-specific areas.

If a PR is closed and you disagree, raise it in Discord. Happy to discuss, not happy to be ambushed in a PR comment thread.

This will likely formalize over time as the project grows.
